					<h2>Introduction</h2>

					<h3>What does DSO (Deep-Sky Object) mean?</h3>

					<p>
						It is something you can see on the sky using binoculars or a
						telescope. "Deep" means that the object is outside of the solar
						system.
					</p>
					<p>
						Examples of what DSOs are:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Galaxies</li>
						<li>Nebulas</li>
						<li>Clusters of stars</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						Examples of what DSOs are not:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Single stars</li>
						<li>Planets</li>
						<li>Moon, Satellites</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Why we made this application?</h3>

					<p>
						There are lots of interesting things to look in the sky, and you can
						already find different well-suited applications to discover them.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is a list of things you can see, including software
						recommendations:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Planets or moon: <a href="https://stellarium.org/">Stellarium</a>
							or mostly anything.</li>
						<li>Artificial satellites:
							<a href="https://heavens-above.com/">Heavens-Above</a>,
							<a href="https://issdetector.com/">ISS-Detector</a>.</li>
						<li>Deep-Sky Objects: This application, or see more alternatives
							below.</li>
						<li>Meteor showers:
							<a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/meteor-shower/">timeanddate</a>,
							<a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/meteors-and-meteorites/overview/">NASA website</a>.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						We think that discovering observable DSOs can be hard, there are a
						lot of articles with "The top 15 Deep Sky Objects for beginners",
						"Brightest astronomy targets for binoculars and telescopes" or "Top
						50 southern night sky objects for small telescopes". But we find
						cumbersome that some objects have different names on different
						lists, that maybe from your location you can't see most of the DSOs
						listed, etc.
					</p>

					<p>
						DSO Guide tries to gather everything in one place, helping to find
						what you can see from your date and location. We are trying to
						answer questions like:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>What are the brightest DSOs?</li>
						<li>On which months I can see this?</li>
						<li>On which months I can see this?</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Alternatives</h3>

					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://telescopius.com/">Telescopius</a>: This is the
							best alternative, make sure to check it too.</li>
						<li><a href="https://stellarium.org/">Stellarium</a>: Useful when
							you know what you want to see. Also has some catalogs on the
							Search window.</li>
						<li>DSO Planner: An Android application that can be useful.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Using this application</h2>

					<h3>Header</h3>

					<p>
						On the top of the page you can register or login. Having an account
						is optional, with it you can store your location and DSO watchlist.
					</p>

					<h3>Settings</h3>

					<p>
						There you can select:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Time and date.</li>
						<li>Your location, enter your coordinates or select from a map.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Sky Chart</h3>

					<p>
						This circle shows the sky on the selected time and location. Objects
						added to the watchlist will be shown on this chart automatically if
						they are above the horizon.
					</p>

					<h3>Watchlist</h3>

					Foto de ejemplo con objetos

					<p>
						This is your personal list of DSOs, these will be shown on the
						<em>Sky Chart</em> and on the <em>Sky Survey</em> window. If you are
						logged in they will be remembered for next login.
					</p>

					<p>
						Columns available on the table:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Name: Some objects can have more than one name, but this
							field generally shows the Messier, NGC or IC names.</li>
						<li>Magnitude: A smaller number means that the object is
							brighter.</li>
						<li>Type: The type of object, being a galaxy, nebula, star cluster,
							etc.</li>
						<li>RA/DEC: Shows the Right Ascension and Declination coordinates of
							the object.</li>
						<li>ALT/AZ: The altitude above the horizon and the Azimuth. It
							depends on the time and location chosen.</li>
						<li>Style: Icon to use when showing the object on the <em>Sky
								Chart</em> or <em>Sky Survey</em> window.</li>
					<li>
						Controls:
						<ul>
							<li>Delete the object from the watchlist, you can still find it on
								the catalog.</li>
							<li>Save changes made to the object on the server. Necessary if
								you changed the style or the notes and you want those to be
								available on next login.</li>
							<li>Survey: Opens the <em>Sky Survey</em> window where you can see
								images from the object.</li>
							<li>Notes: Here you can write information about the object so you
								can remember if you have already seen it, how, when, etc.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Plot: Shows the <em>Visibility Plot</em> of the object, see below
						for more information.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Click the "Filters and Settings" button to show a search field.
						Moreover, you can also sort the table by clicking column headers.
					</p>

					<h3>Catalog</h3>

					<p>
						Contains the list of every DSO known by this application. We call
						it the <em>DSO Guide Catalog</em>, but it contains objects from
						different catalogs. Catalogs are popular lists of DSOs,
						<a href="http://www.messier.seds.org/xtra/similar/catalogs.html">there
							are a lot of them.</a>
						We tried to gather a few so you can easily find popular DSOs.
					</p>

					<p>
						For every object on the <em>DSO Guide Catalog</em> you can see the
						same information available on the Watchlist table, but also:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>A button to add the object to the Watchlist.</li>
						<li>A column named "Appears on", this column shows the list of
							catalogs that contain this object.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						You can guess that objects included on many catalogs must be
						popular, so make sure to check objects with lots of entries on
						"Appears on". At the same time take a look at the Altitude column,
						or better, take the time to understand the plot to determine of you
						can observe it.
					</p>

					<p>
						Try the <em>Filters and Settings</em> dropdown. For example you
						might want to filter only objects in the Southern Sky Binocular.
						Also you can search objects by name.
					</p>

					<h2>Visibility plot</h2>

					<p>
						This is perhaps the most unique and difficult to understand feature
						this program has. It allows you to see at first glance lots of
						information:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Is the object ever visible on my location?</li>
						<li>Does the object ever reach a high altitude or is it always
							really low over the horizon?</li>
						<li>Can I always see it or only on some months?</li>
						<li>On which months can I see this object at evenings?</li>
						<li>On which months can I see this object before sunrise?</li>
					</ul>
